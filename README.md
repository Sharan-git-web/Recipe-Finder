# 🍽️ Recipe Website

A simple recipe website built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## What I Learned
- JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling
- Fetching data from a public API using `fetch()`
- Working with JSON responses
- Dynamically updating UI based on API data
- Understanding API request limits
- Using AI tools to quickly decide colors and improve UI

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Public Recipe API

## Note
The recipe API has a **daily request limit**, so data fetching may not work temporarily.

## Run Locally
Open `index.html` in your browser.
